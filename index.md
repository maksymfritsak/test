# How RAD Handles CT, PET, and MR Data

RAD is designed to support a wide range of medical imaging data types with specific considerations:

## DICOM

For DICOM data, RAD assumes that each patient folder contains only one DICOM series and one RT struct file.

### CT

Details on how RAD processes CT images are provided here.

## NIFTI

RAD supports both `.nii` and `.nii.gz` data formats, offering flexibility in handling NIFTI data.
