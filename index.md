# Advanced: [RAD API](home.md)

For advanced use, we suggest using RAD as a Python library that can be easily integrated into the research workflow.
[Here](api.md) one can find examples of such use.
# How RAD handles CT, PET, and MR data:
Before the rad use one needs to organize the data in folders, folder names should be integers.
## DICOM:
Zrad assumes that in each patient folder only one dicom series and one rt struct file.
### CT
## NIFTI:
Rad supports both .nii and .nii.gz data types.
